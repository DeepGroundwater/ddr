# streamflow_datasets/Specifications

DDR is meant to route a large number of unit-catchments across many timesteps. Therefore, a uniform input specification was developed in order to accomidate the highest number of streamflow inputs.

To get a list of gauges to train your model on, please see the https://github.com/DeepGroundwater/datasets repo.
