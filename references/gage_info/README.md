# Gage Info

This folder contains CSV files mapping USGS streamflow gages to MERIT Hydro COMIDs for use in DDR benchmarking.

**Generated by:** `references/geo_io/build_gage_references.py` — see that script for the full spatial join pipeline.

## Files

### `camels_670.csv`

670 gages from the CAMELS / HCDN-2009 reference basin set. Derived by:

1. Filtering `data/conus_3000_gages.gpkg` to the 671 HCDN-2009 gage IDs found in `data/HCDN_nhru_final_671.shp`.
2. Performing a spatial intersection (point-in-polygon) with MERIT Hydro basins (`data/merit/cat_pfaf_7_MERIT_Hydro_v07_Basins_v01_bugfix1.shp`) in EPSG:5070 to assign each gage a MERIT `COMID`.
3. Dropping 1 coastal gage (`01195100`, Indian River near Clinton, CT) that falls outside MERIT basin coverage.

### `gages_3000.csv`

3211 gages curated by Ouyang et al. (2021) for continental-scale streamflow modeling. Derived by:

1. Matching the 3213 gage IDs in `data/gages3000Info.csv` to `data/conus_3000_gages.gpkg` (zero-filled to 8 characters).
2. Performing a spatial intersection (point-in-polygon) with MERIT Hydro basins in EPSG:5070 to assign each gage a MERIT `COMID`.
3. Dropping 2 coastal gages (`01305500`, Swan River at East Patchogue NY; `01195100`, Indian River near Clinton, CT) that fall outside MERIT basin coverage.

### `GAGES-II.csv`

8945 gages from the GAGES-II dataset (Falcone, 2011), which provides geospatial data and classifications for 9,322 stream gages maintained by the USGS. Derived by:

1. Performing a spatial intersection (point-in-polygon) with MERIT Hydro basins (`data/merit/cat_pfaf_7_MERIT_Hydro_v07_Basins_v01_bugfix1.shp`) in EPSG:5070 to assign each gage a MERIT `COMID`.
2. Dropping 19 coastal gages that fall outside MERIT basin coverage.
3. Dropping 103 gages with non-standard station IDs (9–10 digits) that have no matching USGS streamflow observations. These are likely non-reference gages or sub-stations without available observation records.

### `dhbv2_gages.csv`

2,808 gages from the dHBV2.0 model (Song et al., 2025), used as the primary gage set for DDR training and evaluation on the MERIT Hydro network.

> **WARNING — Drainage area source differs from other gage files:**
>
> | Column | dhbv2_gages.csv | GAGES-II / camels / gages_3000 |
> |--------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
> | `COMID_DRAIN_SQKM` | `zone_edge_uparea` (discretized dHBV2.0 zone-edge network) | MERIT rivers `uparea` (native upstream area) |
>
> Because the drainage area sources differ, `ABS_DIFF`
> is **not directly comparable** across datasets. The zone-edge areas are much closer
> to USGS values (median ABS_DIFF ~3 km² vs ~29 km² for MERIT uparea on the same gages),
> but this reflects the zone-edge discretization, not better gage-to-COMID matching.
>
> To add comparable MERIT-based metrics, re-run the patch script with `--merit-rivers`:
> ```
> python references/geo_io/patch_dhbv2_gages.py \
>     --csv references/gage_info/dhbv2_gages.csv \
>     --merit-catchments data/merit/cat_pfaf_7_*.shp \
>     --merit-rivers /path/to/riv_pfaf_7_*.shp
> ```
> This adds `MERIT_DRAIN_SQKM`, `MERIT_ABS_DIFF`, and `DA_VALID` columns.

### Columns

| Column               | Description                                                        |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `STAID`              | USGS station ID                                                    |
| `STANAME`            | Station name                                                       |
| `DRAIN_SQKM`        | Drainage area (km²) reported by USGS                               |
| `LAT_GAGE`           | Gage latitude (NAD83)                                             |
| `LNG_GAGE`           | Gage longitude (NAD83)                                            |
| `COMID`              | MERIT Hydro basin COMID                                            |
| `COMID_DRAIN_SQKM`  | Upstream area (km²) — see note below                               |
| `COMID_UNITAREA_SQKM`| Local (unit) catchment area (km²) of the COMID                    |
| `ABS_DIFF`           | `abs(DRAIN_SQKM - COMID_DRAIN_SQKM)`                             |
| `DA_VALID`           | `True` if `ABS_DIFF <= COMID_UNITAREA_SQKM` (drainage area mismatch within one local catchment) |
| `FLOW_SCALE`         | Flow scale factor in [0, 1]. Reduces Q' when gage sits upstream of COMID outlet: `(unit_area - \|diff\|) / unit_area`. 1.0 = no scaling needed. |
| `MERIT_DRAIN_SQKM`  | MERIT rivers native `uparea` (km²) — only when `--merit-rivers` used |
| `MERIT_ABS_DIFF`     | `abs(DRAIN_SQKM - MERIT_DRAIN_SQKM)` — comparable across datasets |

**Note:** For GAGES-II, camels_670, and gages_3000, `COMID_DRAIN_SQKM` is MERIT rivers `uparea`. For dhbv2_gages, it is `zone_edge_uparea` from the dHBV2.0 zone-edge network (preserved for flow scaling backward compatibility).
